      <h1>A diary entry for 2/14/2023</h1>
      <p>Today, I began my journey into English interpretation and composition, and after investing time in the process of renting a server, familiarizing myself with GitHub, setting up Ruby on Rails, React, TypeScript, and Next.js, I was only able to construct a basic website. It was already past 7:30 pm. I can't help but ponder if studying data structure and algorithms would count in job hunting. I find myself asking what am I doing? But to put it into perspective, it took me approximately 100 hours to learn the majority of the C language grammar with one-on-one guidance, and it took 27 days. Who can learn multiple technologies used in modern web development and create a flawless website in one day? As a novice who has only been exposed to web development for a mere 5 days, I ended the day learning grammar and attempting challenging tasks that seem unproductive, such as environment construction. Nevertheless, this is only the beginning, and being exposed to modern technology is valuable. I will rest without renting a server and changing the name server, which has yet to be accomplished, but it is obvious that I will not be done tomorrow. I will soon present a website with modern and practical functions and design that could not be imagined from such a basic structure. Thus, I will vocalize my ambition here and go to bed. Have a wonderful evening and make sure to get a good night's rest. I'm really looking forward to seeing you tomorrow and catching up on what's been going on in your life. I'm sure it's been an eventful few weeks and I'm excited to hear all about it. See you soon!</p>
