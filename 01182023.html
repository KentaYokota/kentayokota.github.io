      <h1>A diary entry for 1/19/2023</h1>
      <h3>Today is still the ordinal day of a security guard. </h3>
      <p>It is now 9:30 pm, and I have been doing traffic guidance part-time since morning as usual. I have been starting security work for 3 years now. It is so boring and tedious that I am fed up, but recently there is a shortage of manpower, so the salary of each company is increasing. That's a good thing, at least for the ordinary soldiers. However, since I am a part-timer and not a regular employee, I am unstable. So why can't I be a regular employee? Is Langy originally a dropout who can't become a regular employee in the security industry? I want to argue that it is not. Regular employees are also short-handed, and I am 22 years old born in 2000, and many security jobs are elderly, so young people like me are valuable. I am a high school dropout, but I am a college student at a broadcasting university, so I am not just a high school dropout.</p>
      <h3>Security guards make money because they are part-time.</h3>
      <p>Yes, the string surrounded by h3 tags above is all. Part-time jobs in the metropolitan area are not 10,000 yen for day shift, but rather about 12,000 yen. And you don't have to have some kind of qualification, anyone over 18 who is not bankrupt and has no criminal record can become a security guard, and there is no special skill required, it is something almost anyone can do. And yet it is profitable, so it is better than being a regular employee with a monthly income of about 200,000 yen (note that it is not take-home pay). I often hear that there is no overtime, and I do telephone correspondence that makes me crazy, and I am placed in the field of soldiers, and if the soldier is not feeling well or there is no one, I will do the job at noon and do the night shift and work as a regular employee the next day. Is there such a crappy thing? Yes, there is.</p>
      <h3>Finally Well</h3>
      <p>I'm an expert on security, so I can talk about it more, but I have a physics tutoring class from 10 pm. What, you can teach physics? I'm sure that's rare among people who are looking at this page. I'm the one who requested it and I'm taking the class. And not just physics, I'm learning all kinds of knowledge and technology. Full-time is such a concept that I don't know where it went, I'm working and studying, and today I'm writing and correcting my front-end learning record and my reference book. It's already 10 pm, so I'll do it again sometime.</p>
      <h3>PS</h3>
      <p>This is me when I was feeling full of energy and vigor, like I could take on the world. I was bursting with enthusiasm, ready to tackle any challenge that came my way. My enthusiasm was infectious and I could feel the excitement bubbling up inside me as I thought about the possibilities that lay ahead. I was ready to take on anything that came my way, no matter how difficult it may have seemed.</p>
