        <h3>解答例1</h3>
        <p>
            Living in a concrete jungle surrounded by functionalist architecture, it seems that the opportunity to appreciate the subtle changes of the seasons by listening to the chirping of birds or insects and looking at unfamiliar plants has become increasingly rare. It's understandable that more people are deciding to move to the countryside to gain more mental space and make their one-time-only precious life more fulfilling.
        </p>
        <h3>解答例2</h3>
        <p>
            It appears that urban life, encompassed by concrete buildings and functionalist design, has caused a decrease in the ability to feel the subtle changes of the seasons by listening to the sounds of birds or insects and admiring unfamiliar plants. Due to this, it's no surprise that more individuals are deciding to move to rural areas, hoping to have more mental peace and to create a more enriched, one-time-only life.
        </p>
        <h3>解答例3</h3>
        <p>
            Living in a sterile, inorganic city surrounded by concrete structures, it seems that the experiences of listening to birds chirping or insects buzzing and observing unfamiliar flora, which evoke the subtle changes of the seasons, have become increasingly rare. It's no wonder that individuals are increasingly deciding to move to the countryside, with the desire to have more emotional space and to create a more fulfilling, one-time-only life.

        </h3>
        <p>
            It feels like the ability to appreciate the subtle changes of the seasons by listening to the chirping of birds or insects and observing unfamiliar plants has become increasingly scarce, living in a function-first, inorganic city surrounded by concrete buildings. As a result of this, it's not surprising that more people are deciding to move to rural areas, hoping to have more mental space and to make their one-time-only life more enriching.
        </p>
        <h3>解答例5</h3>
