        <h2>Self-introduction</h2>
        <p>At sixteen, I embarked on part-time labor for the purpose of funding my tuition and books, understanding the significance of toiling and acquiring money for autonomy and intellectual growth; the past year has seen me have a satisfying and enjoyable academic life by connecting to an assortment of persons, such as university students and employed adults, on Twitter, who have imparted specialized knowledge and strengthened my beliefs and directed me in stimulating my intellectual interest.</p>
        <p>My interests, ranging from the humanities to the sciences, are broad and I continually challenge myself with a variety of activities, despite my obligation to work full-time or even more. In an effort to expand my understanding of each field beyond a superficial level, I have engaged tutors to assist me with linguistics, philosophy, logic, mathematics, physics, chemistry, programming in C and Python (data structures and algorithms), as well as a personal hobby, sociology, political science, and psychology. As I am also studying law and have signed a contract with a judicial exam preparatory school called Ito Juku, my primary interest lies in legal philosophy, and thus I have decided to take the judicial exam preparatory test when my preparations for it have been sufficiently established, which I anticipate to occur in 2024 or later.</p>
        <p>My background and career-path: I, who had worked various part-time jobs such as a butcher-shop, Chinese-restaurant, factory, moving-company, sex-industry, Kabukicho-host, and traffic-guidance-security, have been doing the latter since I was 19 years old, not because it was fun, but because it was relatively easy to earn a lot of money. Therefore, I plan to change my job soon, since I'm quite exhausted of this security-guard life. In 2022, I, by chance, stumbled upon a 12-month employment program for people with disabilities, offered by Google, while searching for job-information. I have depression and developmental-disorders such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) and ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), so, if Google doesn't only mean physical disabilities when it says "people with disabilities", I'm eligible for the program. The program is called gReach, and they are looking for experience in programming in C++, Java, JavaScript, or Python, as well as excellent communication-skills in Japanese, both written and verbal; knowledge of general data-structures and algorithms is also desirable. I want to quit being a security-guard and do something more productive and meaningful, and, if possible, I'd like to work at Google; so, I'm currently studying programming, being a student in the Department of General Education, Information Course, at Open University. Last updated on the 20th of January, 2023.</p>
        <p>As a libertarian, I invest a large portion of my assets into furthering my studies. I believe in a society where everyone, including those in Japan, can access knowledge free of charge, regardless of their economic situation. To this end, I created this website to share my knowledge of HTML and CSS and to write articles. Additionally, I have permission from my private tutors to share what I have learned from them, as well as from my own independent studies. The internet provides the capacity to review and modify information, which I take advantage of through my use of Twitter. If I ever come to understand something in a different way, I will make sure to modify or supplement the information I have published here. I will continue to strive to help others learn effectively, until the day I die.</p>
