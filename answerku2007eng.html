            教育とは何かと考えるときに、私が決まって思い出すのが小学校の恩師の顔である。先生は、私たち生徒に、物事に真剣に取り組むことを教えてくださった。その教えは、これまでの私の人生の指針となっている。今から考えると、先生の教えが私の心に響いたのは、先生の尊敬できる誠実な人柄によるところが大きかったように思う。教育において考慮すべきことは、教える内容だけではなく、教える側の人間性でもあるのだ。

            <h3>解答例1</h3>
            When I think about what education means, I always remember the face of my elementary school teacher. This teacher taught us the importance of taking things seriously. That lesson has become a guiding principle in my life. Looking back, I think that the reason this lesson resonated with me so much was because of my teacher's admirable and sincere personality. When considering education, we must remember that it is not just about the content being taught, but also about the character of the teacher.

解答例1解説<br>
I’ll be jiggered if I know what that sign means.<br>
その印がどういうことかおれに分かるものか<br>
(ランダムハウス英和辞典)<br>
He knows damn well what it means!<br>
やつはそれがどういうことかよく知っているはずなのに.<br>
I can’t imagine what it means.<br>
どういう意味かさっぱりわからない.<br>
(コンパスローズ英和辞典)<br>
関係代名詞のwhatは｢…するもの、…すること｣という意味であり、そして名詞節を作る。the thing(s) which …と同じ。mean｢…を表す、…を意味する｣は他動詞であることに注意。
remember the face of my elementary school teacherで直訳では顔を思い出すと言ったようになるが、本質的な意味を考えればこれでもよいことはわかるだろう。文の構造としてはwhen…, SVOである。そして次はtellの過去形taughtが来るSVOO文型。importanceは不可算名詞で｢重要性｣。<br>
take it [or things] easy [seriously]
物事を気楽［まじめ］に考える
(ランダムハウス英和辞典)<br>
の通りにコロケーションとして覚えておくべき英語表現。今回の場合はtakingという動名詞にすることでof…という前置詞句を構成できている。<br>
a guiding principle
指導原理, 指針
(コンパスローズ英和辞典)<br>
このコロケーションも覚えるべき。<br>
looking back (on it)<br>
(くだけて)思い返してみると(分詞構文で使う場合, しばしば主文の主語に関係なく用いられる).<br>
(ウィズダム英和辞典)<br>
the reason SV…となっているがthatが省略されていてその後はreasonの同格的説明。
resonateは自動詞でresonate with…で｢…の心に響く｣である。<br>
The speech resonated with the audience.<br>
演説は聴衆の共感を得た．<br>
(リーダーズ英和辞典)<br>
admirableは形容詞で<br>
(かたく)<人･事などが>称賛すべき[に値する], 感心な; 見事な, 立派な<br>
have many admirable qualities<br>
すばらしい資質がたくさんある.<br>
(ウィズダム英和辞典)<br>
という意味。<br>
sincereはhonestに近い、｢誠実な｣という形容詞。<br>
a sincere friend<br>
誠実な友<br>
She is sincere in her promise.<br>
彼女は約束を破らない（＝She never breaks her promise.）.<br>
 He was gentle and sincere by nature.<br>
彼はもともと優しくて誠実です<br>
(ジーニアス英和辞典)<br>
personalityは不可算名詞で｢人柄、性格、個性｣。When considering educationでSVという構造ではないのは、接続詞と共に使う分詞構文である。分詞構文は単体では意味が曖昧なことがあり、接続詞をつければ意味が明確になる。<br>
While waiting for the train, I bought a newspaper.<br>
(総合英語able)<br>
nót ònly A but (àlso) B＝nót mèrely [sìmply, jùst] A but (àlso) B｢AだけでなくBも｣。<br>
この時計は正確さに加えてデザインのよさでも他社にひけをとらない.<br>
This watch is the equal of anything our rivals are making, not just in accuracy but even in design.<br>
(新和英大辞典)<br>
This is not just about the sales department－we are all in the same boat.<br>
これは営業部だけの問題ではありません．みな同じ船に乗っているのですから．（all in the same boat は「運命共同体」 「一蓮托生」の意）<br>
(オーレックス英和辞典)<br>
この例文のThisがitになったと考えればこういうbe about…という使い方がわかるはずだ。<br>

                最近久しぶりに旅行して実感したのですが、田舎の夜空には星が驚くほどたくさん見えます。科学的に考えれば、汚染がなく空気がきれいだからでしょうが、風景はそれを見る者の心を映すとよく言われます。雑事に追われて忙しいだけの生活からしばしの逃避行を敢行したあの時の私は、もしかしたら、めずらしく無邪気な子どものように心が澄んでいたのかもしれません。

                <h3>解答例1</h3>
                Recently, I went on a trip and realized that the night sky in the countryside has an incredible amount of stars. Scientifically speaking, it's probably because there is no pollution and the air is clean, but it's often said that the scenery reflects the heart of the person looking at it. When I escaped from my busy life for a while and went on that trip, maybe my heart was as clear as that of an innocent child.
